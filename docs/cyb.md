# 0. Overview

Cyb is a web3 browser with integrated DApp platform. You can read more about web3 [here](cyb/docs/web3-vision.md)
There are two main parts of browser:

1. Shell, which alows:

- search data in blockchains, Dapps, and process content via IPFS
- deploy and manage Dapps for users
- manage sync state of nodes: IPFS, Ethereum and Cyber
- manage user's account data (sign transactions, create custom feed)

2. DApps, which:

- provide full user experience in web3
- can be available through IPFS


# 1. Principles

We adhere to such key principles of cyb behavior, design and development.

## Respect users

We focus on developers and advanced blockchain and IPFS users. But cyb is also friendly for everyone who wants to interact with consensus computers.

## Anonimity

We respect user's attitudes and principles. So we offer 3 clear custom types of activity tracking. 

- public activity [user account address + events tracking]
- private activity [abstract ID + events tracking ]
- anonymous activity [no tracking at all]

By default all activity is anonymous. But for successful browser development we need to collect at least public and private data. Thus users of these 2 groups well be incentivized with tokens.
