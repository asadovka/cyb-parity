# 1. Principles

We adhere to such key principles of cyb behavior, design and development.




## Design

Cyb design process follows Web3 design principles.

### 2.1. State rules

We use simple colored states for states of transactions or operations:

- mempool/failed - red
- confirmed/reverted - yellow
- finalized/succesful - green

### 2.2 Data visualisation

Data should be visualised in a simple and attractive way. No overloaded plots an diagrams, we use animation instead.

### 2.3 Blockchain objects presenting

Blockchain data is too complicated and sometimes not obvious for people. Thus we use adaptive tricks to make work process more convenient:

1. Logical grouping for objects. Every app page has common groups of data (general, blockchain specific) for inheritance of views and better navigation or data observing.
2. Classical accounting terms used for balance and cashflow operations. Blockahains use econimic principles for interaction between subjects thus we can describe such processes in established terms.
3. Robohash logo for contracts entities. Contracts can act by themself, have and algorithms, so it's more natural to perceive them like robots instead of pieces of code.
