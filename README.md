## This is our experimental repo. We've forked parity ui, transformed, upgraded it and even made couple of [releases](https://github.com/cybercongress/cyb-parity/releases)!

## But now we face too much problems with it. So we decided to return to our [first cyb repo](https://github.com/cybercongress/cyb) and write a new web3 browser from a scratch.
